Multiple Passwords :

1] Simple Passwords =

Ex: password

    sunshine123

    qwerty12

These are easy to remember but not recommended for real use due to low complexity.

2] Moderate Passwords =

Ex: BlueSky2025

    JohnDoe95

    HappyDay89

These are moderately strong and more secure than simple passwords.

3] Strong Passwords =

Ex: G!T9z@39BmXq

    W@t3rF@ll!92$Xy

    #C0d3_R3v!ew9*Q

These are difficult for attackers to guess or brute-force.


4] Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords :

- Use long passwords—at least 12-16 characters is recommended, and more is better for security.

- Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols to maximize complexity.

- Avoid using dictionary words, common phrases, or personal information like names and birthdates; these are easy  to guess in dictionary attacks.

- Don’t reuse passwords across different accounts. Each account should have a unique password to minimize risk if one password is compromised.

- Consider using passphrases (combinations of random words and symbols) for better security and easy recall.

- Use a password manager to help generate and store strong, unique passwords for every account.

- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible, adding another layer of security beyond your password.


5] Key Learnings & Observations :

- Password length and the inclusion of multiple character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) have the biggest impact on strength scores.

- Simple passwords are weak because they are shorter and predictable, making them easy targets for attackers.

- Many password checkers show that even if complex, short passwords are still vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

- Best results come from mixing random characters, avoiding repetition, and steering clear of known patterns or sequential keys.

- Password managers and MFA are crucial tools for modern cybersecurity habits, especially when managing multiple accounts.


6] Explanation: Brute Force and Dictionary Attacks :

- A brute force attack is when an attacker uses software to systematically try every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until the correct password is found. The time to crack a password grows significantly with each additional character, which is why longer and more complex passwords are more secure.

- A dictionary attack is a specific type of brute force attack in which attackers use lists of common words, phrases, and passwords (like those found in leaked databases or regular dictionaries) to guess passwords quickly. These attacks are successful when passwords are common words or predictable variations.

7] How Password Complexity Defends Against Attacks:

- Complex passwords containing a random mix of letters, numbers, and symbols are much harder for software to guess using brute force or dictionary methods. They drastically increase the number of possibilities attackers need to test, making such attacks computationally expensive and often unfeasible.

8] Conclusion :

- In conclusion, understanding and applying strong password practices is essential for safeguarding personal and organizational accounts against modern cyber threats. By using long, complex, and unique passwords while recognizing the risks posed by brute force and dictionary attacks, individuals can greatly enhance their security posture and reduce vulnerability to unauthorized access.
