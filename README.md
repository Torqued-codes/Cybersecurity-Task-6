## Cybersecurity Task 6 : Password Strength Evaluation Report


## i] Overview : 
This project is part of a Cybersecurity Internship Task aimed at understanding what makes a password strong and evaluating password strength using online tools. The task includes creating multiple passwords of varying complexity, testing them, and analyzing the results to learn best practices for creating secure passwords.

## ii] Objective :

- To learn how to create strong passwords that can resist common cyber-attacks.

- To evaluate password strength using an online password strength checker.

- To understand password complexity and common attack methods such as brute force and dictionary attacks.

## iii] Password Categories :

- Simple Passwords: Easy to remember but weak (ex : password).

- Moderate Passwords: More secure by combining upper and lowercase letters and numbers (ex : JohnDoe95).

- Strong Passwords: Complex passwords using mixed character types and symbols (ex : W@t3rF@ll!92$Xy).

## iv] Methodology :

- Created multiple passwords with different complexity levels.

- Tested each password using an online password strength checker.

- Recorded the scores, feedback, and other metrics.

- Identified best practices for secure password creation.

- Researched common password attack techniques.

- Compiled key learnings and conclusions.

## v] Best Practices for Strong Passwords :

- Use passwords with at least 12-16 characters.

- Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

- Avoid common words, phrases, or personal info.

- Do not reuse passwords across different accounts.

- Consider passphrases for both strength and memorability.

- Use password managers to generate and store complex passwords.

- Enable multi-factor authentication for extra security.

## vi] Key Learnings :

- Password length and character variety significantly enhance security.

- Simple and short passwords are vulnerable to attacks.

- Password managers and multi-factor authentication improve overall security posture.

- Avoid predictable patterns and repetition in passwords.

## vii] Understanding Password Attacks :

- Brute Force Attacks: Attempt every possible combination to guess the password.

- Dictionary Attacks: Use common words and combinations to guess passwords quickly.

- Complex, random passwords increase difficulty for attackers and reduce risk.

## viii] Deliverables :

- Password strength scores and screenshots.

- Analysis and report on password strengths.


## ix] Conclusion :

Understanding and applying strong password practices is essential for safeguarding personal and organizational accounts against modern cyber threats. By using long, complex, and unique passwords while recognizing the risks posed by brute force and dictionary attacks, individuals can greatly enhance their security posture and reduce vulnerability to unauthorized access.
